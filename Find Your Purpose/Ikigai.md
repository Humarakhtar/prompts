# **Ikigai Concept**  

Ikigai (生き甲斐) is a Japanese concept that means “reason for being.” It’s the sweet spot where your **passion, mission, vocation, and profession** meet. Follow this guide to uncover your Ikigai by answering reflective questions and taking small steps towards clarity.  

### **Step 1: Reflect on What You Love**  
Take a moment to think about what brings you joy and energy. Ask yourself:  
- What activities make me lose track of time?  
- What hobbies or interests have always been with me, even since childhood?  
- What would I do for free, just because I enjoy it?  

**Exercise:** List at least five things you love. Don’t limit yourself—include anything that excites you, big or small.

### **Step 2: Identify What You’re Good At**  
Now, focus on your skills and strengths. These can be talents you’ve developed over time or things that come naturally to you. Ask yourself:  
- What do others often praise me for?  
- What tasks do I complete with ease and confidence?  
- What skills have I developed through work, study, or life experience?  

**Exercise:** Write down five things you’re good at, including both hard skills (like coding, writing, or design) and soft skills (like listening, empathy, or problem-solving).

### **Step 3: Explore What the World Needs**  
Consider how your passions and skills can make a difference. Think about the problems you’d love to help solve. Ask yourself:  
- What issues or causes do I deeply care about?  
- What do people often ask for my help with?  
- How can my skills contribute to others’ lives or the world?  

**Exercise:** List three areas where you believe you could create a positive impact.

### **Step 4: Determine What You Can Be Paid For**  
This step grounds your Ikigai in reality. Explore how your passions and skills can be monetised. Ask yourself:  
- What roles or industries align with my interests and talents?  
- Are there businesses or services that need what I offer?  
- What’s a job or side hustle I’ve always dreamed of trying?  

**Exercise:** Brainstorm ways to earn an income using your top skills and passions.

### **Step 5: Find the Overlap**  
Now that you’ve reflected on these four areas, it’s time to find the connections.  
- **Passion:** What you love + What you’re good at  
- **Mission:** What you love + What the world needs  
- **Vocation:** What the world needs + What you can be paid for  
- **Profession:** What you’re good at + What you can be paid for  

**Exercise:** Draw the Ikigai diagram (four overlapping circles) and start filling in your answers from each step. Look for common themes or patterns.

### **Step 6: Take Action**  
Clarity comes from action. Choose one small step you can take today to move closer to your Ikigai. It could be:  
- Volunteering for a cause you care about.  
- Taking a course to improve a skill.  
- Reaching out to someone in a field that excites you.  

**Remember:** Your Ikigai doesn’t have to be perfect or immediate. It’s a journey, not a destination. Trust the process and adjust along the way.
