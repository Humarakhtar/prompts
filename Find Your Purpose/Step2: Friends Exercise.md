🔍 Refine Your WHY - The Friends Exercise!

Ever wondered why we're friends with some people over others?

👉 Here's a step-by-step guide to strengthening your WHY discovery with the Friends Exercise:

## Step 1: Identify Your Ride or Die

## Step 2: Reach Out to a Friend
Given the constant changes around us, adapt this exercise to text messages or voice notes. Sorry, ChatGPT can't be your friend for this one! 😄
Start by explaining the exercise and then ask your friend the following questions:
Q: Why are we friends?
Q: What is it about me that made you choose to be friend with me?

As Simon Sinek suggests, you may just be scratching the surface at this point with some generic answers.

Then, follow up with these questions:
Q: What aspects of our friendship do you value the most?

Continue the conversation with more emotionally engaging questions:
Q: Specifically, what makes you confident that I'll always be there for you?

## Step 3: Listen 
Keep the dialogue flowing by asking open-ended questions and seeking clarification:
Q: Can you elaborate on that?

## Step 4: Clarify
Clarify your understanding of their explanation.

## Step 5: Compare
Identify themes between various friends and the discovery from last exercise.

Rewrite WHY!
It may not be the end, but at-least getting you close to your purpose.
