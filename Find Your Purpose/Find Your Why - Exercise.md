Here is a step-by-step guide for discovering your WHY (+Prompt to help you find patterns):

## Step 1: Gather your stories
Tip: Go old school with pen and paper. Start writing when some thoughts trigger.

## Step 2: Share your stories
Tip: Life is busy, and so are our partners/friends. If you find this journey super personal, why not use my prompt to delve deep? And hopefully, ChatGPT won't judge you. ðŸ˜‰

# Prompt:
You are a trusted partner and are well-versed in Simon Sinek's books, 'Start with WHY' and 'Find Your WHY'. There will be five stories and two steps to the process. Ask me the first story from my life and pose questions to discover 'Facts' and 'Meaning'. Once I provide enough depth, move onto the next story and repeat the discovery process for all five stories. Now, list meaningful themes you discovered in all stories. Shall we begin?

## Step 3: Discover themes
Tip: This will be the most challenging of all. Maybe the above prompt can help you.

## Step 4: Draft your Why
Tip: This might be the hardest of all, as this will define you.

# Prompt:
Based on the above discovery and themes identified, now please help me write the WHY statement in the format, "To __________ so that _______".
